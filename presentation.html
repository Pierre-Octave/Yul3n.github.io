            1 year ago, I wanted a challenge, so I searched on internet some
            challenges, I found some algorithms that looked interesting, like
            the Kadane's one. I started to try implementing it in rust because
            it looked like an cool language, since I've already done some Ocaml
            - which I find very good. But I had a bad experience with it, where
            Ocaml can guess types of your variables and functions, most of the
            time you have to specify types and size off them in rust. And I had
            a lot of problems with this system. Plus the fact that you need to
            use the cargo manager and a .toml config file to manage your
            projects whereas I prefer to use my file plus a little Makefile. It
            maked me think of a challenge I've seen on internet: creating my own
            language. <br /> <br /> As a consequence, I took everything I liked
            in programming languages and wrote them on paper. When I had a first
            syntax, I started looking for tutorials and I saw a lot of them was
            using Lex and Bison but I wanted to do things myself so I took
            remaining tutorials but none of them was in C and I really wanted to
            write it in C, because I wanted to learn this language. The compiler
            nearly worked and transpiled to C and was very bug since it had no
            real parser. I finally gave up since it was a horrible mess full of
            little hacks. So 30 days ago, I started my holidays without anything
            to do and I decided to restart the project from the beginning.
            <br /><br /> I started following tutorials written in other
            languages and algorithms for parsing found on internet and started
            translating them in C. And then I started writting a simple
            interpreter for the ASTs I generated, it worked but was a bit buggy.
            So I started learning assembler to be able to write a compiler. And
            here we are. <br /><br />
            The main inspirations for Zdeta are Ocaml, Python and a bit of Golang.
