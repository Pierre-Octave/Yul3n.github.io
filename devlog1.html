            This week, my main goal is to implement arrays, to be able to
            implement. I also want to discover some bugs and fix them. <br /><br />
            First I looked for memory leaks using the Valgrind tool, after a bit
            of troubleshooting I found all my memory leaks and fixed them using
            a lot of free and by modifying the freeall function.
